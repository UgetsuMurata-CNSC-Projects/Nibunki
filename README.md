# Nibunki
A binary tree console project using Python.

## How to use:
1. Download the **release version 1.0**.
2. Run **Nibunki.exe**.
3. Resize the console until it displays properly.

## Tips in resizing the window
1. Maximize the window.
2. Click enter (if you just opened the exe) or left/right keys (if you are in the main interface).
3. If the display is still broken, click "ctrl" + "-" to make the font of your console smaller. Update the display by repeating step 2.
